How the heck do you reference an IIS application pool user when you need to give it access to a directory?  I never can remember either! I flounder around trying different combinations.  I question whether it needs quotes.  I look for the right stack overflow question and never seem to find it.  So here it is for you and I to remember.  Don't worry about the spaces and no need for quotation marks.


	IIS AppPool\application pool name
